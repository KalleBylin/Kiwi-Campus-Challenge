# Robotics Challenge

# Let's start

---

**Kiwi Campus Inc**, the biggest delivery company with robots in Sillicon Valley welcomes you to this new challenge of robotics and machine learning. If you are reading this, you will start in a few minutes the robotics challenge for **Kiwi Campus Inc.**

We will evaluate your abilities of fast learning, synergy, self-learning and quality in the way of solving problems, so take ownership of this and enjoy it!

The challenge consists of a guide on ROS (Robotics operating system) that engineers of **Kiwi Campus Inc** have done with a lot of detail, there you will have to solve step by step simulations, programming tasks and deployment of environments (packages) to complete the challenge, you can find theoretical questions in different points, as well as tests to know your ability using ROS.

Do not forget that ROS has a very large community in the world. The ROS's Wiki is the closest way to solve problems and issues.
