# Kiwi-Campus-Challenge
Kiwi Campus Inc, the biggest delivery company with robots in Sillicon Valley welcomes you to this new challenge of robotics and machine learning. 

To have a valid solution for the challenge you must send a link with the GitHub repo of your solution to diana@kiwicampus.com . Please do not share your solution (this will make sure other competitors do not take advantage of your work) until the 18 of May when the challenge had finished, this will make sure that other competitors do not have access to your solution and therefore may unfairly pass. 

You have an 8 day deadline to solve it. In the repository, the Issues area is open to report questions about the challenge and tasks, please write everything in english. Do not send emails with questions about the challenges, everything not on the issues area shall be ignored.

Please start the name of your issues with a [machine learning] or [robotics] tag, for example:

**[machine learning] use of Theano**

I am interested in completing the task with Theano. Can I use it?


by the way...the answer is NO!
