# Kiwi-Campus-Challenge
Kiwi Campus Inc, the biggest delivery company with robots in Sillicon Valley welcomes you to this new challenge of robotics and machine learning. 

To have a valid solution for the challenge you must send a link with the GitHub repo of your solution to diana@kiwicampus.com . Please keep your solution private until the 18 of May when the challenge had finished, this will make sure that other competitors do not have access to your solution and therefore may unfairly pass. 


You have an 8 day deadline to solve it. In the repository, the Issues area is open to report questions about the challenge and tasks, please write everything in english.

Please start the name of your issues with a [machine learning] or [robotics] tag, for example:

**[machine learning] use of Theano**
